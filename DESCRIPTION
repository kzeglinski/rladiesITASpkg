Description: A package to store helper functions and data for our annual event at 
    It Takes A Spark - Become a Disease Detective - a workshop to introduce school students 
    to coding, R and epidemiology. These helper functions are mostly simple wrappers around
    ggplot2 functions, so students don't need to grasp the intricacies of that package.
